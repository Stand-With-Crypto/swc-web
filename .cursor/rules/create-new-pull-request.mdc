# Creating a new Pull Request

If the user has Github MCP [mcp.json](mdc:/Users/lucas/.cursor/mcp.json) configured, use it. If not, use GitHub CLI.

## Pre-PR Checklist
1. Ensure we're on a proper feature branch (not main/master)
2. Verify all changes are committed and pushed
3. Run `npm run audit` to ensure linting and tests pass
4. For UI changes, request screenshots for mobile/web

## Branches & Commits
- Use [conventional commits](mdc:https:/www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) and [conventional branch](mdc:https:/conventional-branch.github.io)
- Target `main` branch unless specified otherwise
- Separate commits by scope/functionality of the PR

## Steps to create the PR
1. Use the template from [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](mdc:.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Request the user about closing issues:
   - GitHub issues: Read from [swc-web](mdc:https:/github.com/Stand-With-Crypto/swc-web) repo and link as [issue-id](mdc:issue-link) in `closes` section
   - GitHub URLs: Link as [issue-id](mdc:issue-link) in `closes` section
   - Sentry issues: Link in `fixes` section (e.g., PROD-SWC-WEB-1JE)
   - If none provided, remove `fixes` and `closes`
3. When prisma schema changes, request PlanetScale deploy request URL
4. Ensure testing checkboxes are appropriately marked
5. Mark "AI Generated" in Notes to Reviewers
6. For large/complex changes, consider creating as draft initially
