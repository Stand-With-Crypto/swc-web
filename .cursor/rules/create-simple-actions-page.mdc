# Creating a Simple Actions Page

A **simple actions page** is a page with a title, description, and some calls to action (**CTAs**) for a user to complete.

---

## Requirements

This are the keypoints you need to know before getting started:

1. The campain title and subtitle.
2. The campaign actions.
3. The campaign date.
4. The path for the new page.
5. The contries the campaign must target.

## How to Create a Simple Campaign Page

1. Navigate to `src/components/app/pageSimpleCampaign/ctas`. In the folder with the country's slug, create a new file named after your campaign in **camelCase**.

2. Write the CTAs file based on the `UserActionGridCTA` interface, located at `src/components/app/userActionGridCTAs/types/index.ts`. You can use `src/components/app/pageSimpleCampaign/ctas/us/dayOfAction.tsx` as an example. Look in the `commons` folder (`src/components/app/pageSimpleCampaign/ctas/commons`) and use the existing CTAs there whenever possible. **Avoid copying and pasting existing common CTAs without a good reason.**

3. If any of the actions requires to create a new email campaign, follow the steps of `.cursor/rules/create-new-email-action-campaign.mdc`.

4. Add the campaign name and date (for example, `DAY_OF_ACTION_AUG_14_2025`) to the `SimpleCampaignName` enum in `src/components/app/pageSimpleCampaign/types.ts`.

5. Add the campaign to the country-specific index file (e.g. `src/components/app/pageSimpleCampaign/ctas/us/index.tsx`). The key must be the `SimpleCampaignName` you just added, and the value should be the campaign you created in step 2.

6. Create the page itself. Following the Next.js app router structure, import `PageSimpleCampaign` (`src/components/app/pageSimpleCampaign/index.tsx`) and pass the `title`, `subtitle`, `campaign name`, and `country code` for each of the required countries.

7. You're all set. Run `npm run audit` to validate if nothing is broken.
