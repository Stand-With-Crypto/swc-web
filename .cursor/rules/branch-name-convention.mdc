## Branch Naming Prefixes
The branch specification by describing with `feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/` and `chore/` and it should be structured as follows:

`<type>/<optional issue number>/<description>`

`feature/`: For new features (e.g., `feature/add-login-page`)
`fix/`: For bug fixes (e.g., `fix/fix-header-bug`)
`hotfix/`: For urgent fixes (e.g., `hotfix/security-patch`)
`chore/`: For non-code tasks like dependency, docs updates (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

## Basic Rules

Use Lowercase Alphanumeric and Hyphens: Always use lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens to separate words. Avoid special characters, underscores, or spaces.
No Consecutive or Trailing Hyphens: Ensure that hyphens are used singly, with no consecutive hyphens (`feature/new--login`) or at the end (`feature/new-login-`).
Keep It Clear and Concise: The branch name should be descriptive yet concise, clearly indicating the purpose of the work.
Include Ticket Numbers: If applicable, include the ticket number from your project management tool to make tracking easier. For example, for a #123 issue, the branch name could be `feature/123/new-login`.
