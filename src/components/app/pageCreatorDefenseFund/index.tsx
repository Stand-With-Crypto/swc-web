        No, applying for support does not guarantee legal support. Legal support is provided at the

        The Creator Legal Defense Fund primarily focuses on providing support for legal challenges

    accordionTitle: 'How long does it take to receive a response?',
    accordionContent: (
      <p>
        The review process may take several weeks, depending on the complexity of a case and the
        volume of applications. If your application is selected, you will be contacted directly with
        further information. Importantly, if you have received a notice from the government or a
        legal complaint that requires a response, you should make sure to meet any deadlines and
        requirements; submitting an application to the Creator Legal Defense Fund does not have any
        impact on those deadlines and requirements.

        attorney who will represent you and who will provide legal services to you. Nothing on this
        website should be considered legal advice, and submitting an application to the Creator
        Defense Fund does not create an attorney-client relationship.

            This partnership is about defending artists and creators who seek to harness the power
            of blockchain technology while galvanizing the crypto community to advocate for our
            collective rights. You can make a difference by directly pressing the SEC to reconsider
            its approach in a misguided regulatory environment. Email the SEC to express your
            concerns and advocate for policies that protect creative freedom and support innovation.
            Let your voice be heard, and join us in educating the crypto community about politicians
            who support common-sense blockchain policies.
