          Nearly nine in ten Americans believe the financial system is overdue for an update. Yet,
          US policymakers seem content on maintaining the status quo, rather than fulfilling their
          responsibilities. This inaction places our nation at risk of losing millions of jobs, and
          driving innovation and global leadership offshore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Stand With Crypto Alliance, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, champions for clear, common-sense
          regulations for the crypto industry. We're mobilizing the 52 million crypto owners in the
          US - a demographic that is younger (60% Gen-Z and Millennials) and more diverse (41%
          identify as racial minorities) than the general US population - to unlock crypto's
          innovation potential and foster greater economic freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enough is enough. It's time for our policymakers to step up, embrace the future, and enact
          clear rules for crypto to thrive.

          Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, aren't just digital tokens; they are the new

          It's imperative that America not only contributes to this evolution, but also ensures its

          But your voice is crucial. It's not about sending tweets; it's about driving real change.
          Elected officials need to recognize the crypto community's passion, demands, and readiness
          to hold them accountable. We can't just be a "squeaky wheel"; we need to roar with unity,
          ensuring our calls for change are heard and enacted.
