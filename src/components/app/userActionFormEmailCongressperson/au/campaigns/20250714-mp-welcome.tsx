${maybeAdvocateIntro} I am one of your constituents. I'm writing to congratulate you on your recent election to Parliament and wish you well as you work to advance our community's interests in Canberra.

As a voter in your electorate, and one of more than 4 million Australian's that own, build, or develop crypto, digital assets and blockchain technology I urge you to support and prioritise digital asset and stablecoin reforms. While often associated with finance, this technology offers far broader benefits, from secure digital identity to more efficient public services. It's a tool that can help boost productivity, support entrepreneurs, and strengthen consumer trust.

This technology offers significant potential for not only Australia, but also our electorate in terms of jobs, economic growth and even financial inclusivity.

Other countries are already moving to integrate blockchain into their innovation plans.
Australia has the talent and values to lead in this space if we take thoughtful steps forward.

I support candidates who prioritise responsible crypto policies and encourage you to champion this transformative industry.

Thank you for your consideration.${fullNameSignOff}`
