If crypto doesn't succeed in Australia, then jobs, innovation, and new technologies will be driven overseas and our country will miss out on the massive benefits.\n\nI hope that you will keep the views of pro-crypto constituents like myself in mind as you carry on your work in Parliament.${fullNameSignOff}`
