  return `The House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives passed historic, bipartisan legislation in July. I am asking you to support the bill when it comes to the floor for a full House vote.

    The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act ("FIT21") addresses a pressing need for regulatory clarity in the United States for crypto. A vote for this bill is a vote to protect customers, promote job opportunities, and bolster national security.
