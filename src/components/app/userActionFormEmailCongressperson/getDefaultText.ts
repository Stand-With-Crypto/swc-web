${maybeDistrictIntro} and recently learned that the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act Bill [FIT 21 H.R. 4763] is being considered for a floor vote in the House.

I am asking you to vote YES on the FIT21 Bill to protect consumers, create jobs, foster innovation, and safeguard our national security.

FIT21 sets foundational rules for crypto that are pro-consumer and pro-job creation. It will protect 52 million Americans who own crypto and create millions of jobs in a critical technology sector that supports our national security.

We have been waiting patiently for years for our lawmakers to protect us and strengthen Americaâ€™s role in building the future of money and the internet.

I am excited the House is going to vote on FIT21, and I am asking you to vote YES for the Bill in order to create a clear regulatory framework to protect consumers for the road ahead.${fullNameSignOff}`
