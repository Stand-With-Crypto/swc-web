That’s good for our economic and national security.\n\nCrypto needs clear rules, regulations, and guidelines to thrive in America, and we need members of Congress like you to champion this powerful technology so that it can reach its full potential. If crypto doesn’t succeed in America, then jobs, innovation, and new technologies will be driven overseas and our country will miss out on the massive benefits.\n\nI hope that you will keep the views of pro-crypto constituents like myself in mind as you carry on your work in Congress.${fullNameSignOff}`
