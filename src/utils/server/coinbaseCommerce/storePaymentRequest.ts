/**
 * NOTE: All the fields reference below will be found in the `metadata` field.
 * NOTE: The email field is only provided (and technically used) if the user accesses the default Coinbase Commerce payment URL.
 *   This is because the default Coinbase Commerce payment URL will force the user to enter an email address before proceeding to payment options.
 *   (Later on, we are most likely going to take in email address when supporting Retail Dapps' SwC mini-dapp.)
 * NOTE: we cannot use `payment.event.data.payments.payer_addresses` to check for wallet existence because
 *   if the user uses their Coinbase account to donate, then the payment address will be set to one of Coinbase's hot wallets, which is incorrect to record.
 *
 * (1) If we have a user ID, then the user definitely (should) exist, and we can store the payment request under the user. Done!
 * - If we do NOT have a user ID, then we move to case (2).
 *
 * (2) If we have a session ID, then we perform the following:
 * - If there is a user attached to the session ID, then we easily store the payment request under the user. Done!
 * - If there is NO user attached to the session ID, then we move to case (3).
 *
 * (3) If we do not have a session ID at all OR if there is NO user attached to the session ID, then we perform the following:
 * - We log this event to Sentry if there is no session ID at all because we need to understand how/why this situation happened and its cadence.
 * - If the response has an email address in the metadata:
 *   - If we can find a user whose primary email address matches the response's email address and is verified, then we easily store the payment request under the user. Done!
 *   - If not, then we attempt to find the first user who has this email address as a secondary email address and is verified. If that is found, then we store. Done!
 *   - If we cannot find anyone based on email address, then we move to case (4).
 *
 * (4) If we are unable to find any user even with session ID or email address, then we perform the following:
 * - We log this event to Sentry because we need to understand how/why this situation happened and its cadence.
 * - We create a new user from scratch, create the email address record, and update/create the appropriate session.
