        <p className="mb-4">
          Voters who own crypto could determine the outcome of November's presidential election,
          according to John Anzalone, a pollster for President Joe Biden's 2020 election run.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          Crypto "could be a really important swing universe," Anzalone said at a press conference
          Wednesday held by Stand with Crypto, a nonprofit advocacy organization.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          "I don't care whether you're a Democrat or you're a Republican — this is a group that you
          should talk to as a candidate, whether its presidential or whether you're a Senate or
          congressional or state legislative candidate," he added. "This is a group that is now
          gaining strength and has power and has a voice, and that becomes really important."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Anzalone is the founder of Impact Research and has worked as a Democratic pollster for
          Biden, former President Barack Obama, and former presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He
          also serves on crypto exchange Coinbase's global advisory council.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of Stand with Crypto, which now counts 1.3
          million members, according to Logan Dobson, the group's executive director. To become a
          member, you must sign up with an email address or link to a cryptocurrency wallet.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Dobson pointed to the recent debate over the Financial Innovation and Technology for the
          21st Century Act as an example of the group's success and influence.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          FIT-21 is an industry-supported congressional bill that would create a custom regulatory
          structure for digital assets. The proposed legislation passed the House of Representatives
          with a surprising level of Democratic support.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Senate hasn't yet taken up the bill and the Biden administration said that while it
          didn't support that specific law, it is eager to work with Congress on a custom set of
          regulations.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          "Our advocates over the past year…have sent over 200,000 emails and calls to members of
          Congress demonstrating the power and influence of our community," Dobson said, adding that
          Stand with Crypto added 400,000 members in the two weeks leading up to the vote of FIT-21.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Stand with Crypto does not endorse individual candidates, but it does grade candidates
          based on their statements and actions taken in office.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It has given Trump an A rating, stating that he "strongly supports crypto" based on
          numerous statements and policy proposals he's issued during the current campaign cycle.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Those statements contrast with those made during his presidency and regulatory actions
          taken by his administration, including the Securities and Exchange Commission's
          controversial lawsuit against Ripple.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Stand with Crypto, an advocacy organization for voters who own cryptocurrencies, saw its
          membership surpass 1 million on Wednesday, as crypto backers push politicians to create a
          new regulatory framework for the digital asset industry while averting more onerous
          compliance requirements.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Brian Armstrong, chief executive of Coinbase, an online platform for buying and selling
          crypto that helped launch Stand With Crypto last August, said the group's rapid growth
          showed the potential voting power of cryptocurrency users.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          "It's a much bigger voting bloc than most people probably would have anticipated,"
          Armstrong told Reuters.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The cryptocurrency industry is spending tens of millions of dollars in U.S. elections this
          year to boost crypto-friendly candidates and defeat those pushing for more regulation.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Coinbase on Monday announced a $25 million donation to the pro-crypto political action
          committee Fairshake, matching recent contributions from crypto payments company Ripple and
          tech-focused venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Stand with Crypto has targeted voters in swing states and now has nearly 24,000 members in
          Georgia, where Democratic President Joe Biden beat Republican Donald Trump in 2020 by
          11,779 votes, and over 16,000 members in Arizona, where Biden won by just over 10,000
          votes.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Armstrong said a surge in the group's membership was fueled by frustration over Biden's
          May 31 veto of a measure that aimed to overturn the Securities and Exchange Commission's
          accounting bulletin on crypto assets, and by strong support for the Republican-sponsored
          bill that would create a new legal framework for digital currencies.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Republican-led House of Representatives passed the so-called Financial Innovation and
          Technology for the 21st Century Act last month with bipartisan support although the White
          House has said it opposes it. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has warned the bill could create new
          risks for investors and markets.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Coinbase officials have met with White House and Biden administration officials over the
          past several months on the issues, a source with the matter said.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Armstrong said he was not backing a presidential candidate because he felt crypto issues
          should be bipartisan to ensure passage of needed legislation.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          "But he said Biden's veto last week was clearly 'a bad political move' given broad
          bipartisan support for the measure."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          "I think that it's just bad politics to be anti-crypto. There's no voter constituency that
          you're winning over by doing that, but you are upsetting a huge number of Americans who've
          used this technology," he said.

        <p className="mb-4">
          There's a new crypto Political Action Committee (PAC) on the scene. Coinbase-initiated
          nonprofit Stand With Crypto announced it is launching a new PAC Friday.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The associated PAC, which means only individual Stand With Crypto members can contribute
          up to $5,000 each, plans to back "candidates who support the crypto community," the
          nonprofit said on X Friday.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Stand With Crypto, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, launched last summer as an effort
          to give crypto fans more access to information about policy makers and candidates, leaders
          said.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          "This is a grassroots, organic bottom-up effort," Kara Calvert, Coinbase's head of US
          policy, said in August 2023 when announcing the new initiative.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          "It can provide a lot of tools to people, they can learn about the members of Congress,
          they can access a scorecard, they can access a legislative action portal… it will really
          give them the tools that they need to engage with their members of Congress," Calvert
          added.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          While federal law makes contributions to the PAC tricky, companies and individuals are
          free to make donations to the nonprofit itself. Crypto payments operation Moonpay on
          Monday announced a $1 million pledge, an effort the company said was inspired by upcoming
          elections.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          "Today, two things are abundantly clear: This year's election will define the future of
          our industry in the United States, and it is our responsibility to step up and stand
          alongside those organizations that want to positively advance crypto innovation for
          everyone," Ivan Soto-Wright, Moonpay CEO, said in a statement Monday.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Stand With Crypto's PAC comes on the scene as crypto-focused Super PAC trio Defend
          American Jobs, Fairshake, and Protect Progress continue to dish out cash. The three groups
          have collectively deployed $31,752,033.81 so far this calendar year, according to Federal
          Election Commission filings.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The PACs made a big financial push during the March Congressional primary cycle, doling
          out more than $10.1 million to fund advertisements against Rep. Katie Porter, the
          incumbent Democrat from California who ultimately lost her bid for the late Sen. Dianne
          Feinstein's seat.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The trio is also backing Alabama Democrat Shomari Figures, who is vying for a US House
          seat in November. Protect Progress donated close to $2 million during his primary campaign
          in March and April, filings show.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Stand With Crypto has not yet filed contribution and disbursement forms with the FEC, but
          has revealed its first five endorsements: Figures; Jim Banks, a Republican running for
          Senate in Indiana; Jim Justice, a Republican running for Senate in West Virginia; Eddy
          Morales, a Democrat running to represent Oregon's Third District; and Troy Downing, a
          Republican running to represent Montana's Second District.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Crypto advocacy group Stand With Crypto is opening its own Political Action Committee
          ahead of this year's elections. The group's own members will support the PAC, though
          they're limited to $5,000 contributions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The fast-growing organization of cryptocurrency supporters, Stand With Crypto, is getting
          into campaign financing with the opening of its own political action committee (PAC) that
          will make direct donations to endorsed congressional candidates, said Chief Strategist
          Nick Carr. Its opening slate of endorsements will feature five candidates seeking open
          seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, though the money will have to wait.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Stand With Crypto's effort is an "associated PAC," meaning it's supported by the nonprofit
          group's own members, and each of them will be limited to $5,000 contributions. Once they
          start adding cash to the PAC coffers, then the committee can start making direct donations
          to candidates as they face the latter months of the primaries and the big contest of
          November's general election, the group announced Friday.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          "I think it's incredible to see the amount of growth in such a short time span of Stand
          With Crypto," Carr said in an interview with CoinDesk. His organization, started in August
          2023, now reports more than 443,000 people signing on. Separately from the PAC, the
          organization says it's raised more than $86 million to conduct advocacy operations, which
          have included supporter events, town halls and a presidential candidate forum.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Though billed as a grassroots organization, some of its major donations have come from
          corporate names, such as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Coinbase launched the group last
          year.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          What separates the new PAC from other prominent crypto campaign-finance efforts is the
          others have been dominated by a handful of major digital assets businesses, giving $10
          million or more to Fairshake and affiliated PACs. Those organizations target candidates
          with unlimited indirect support that's deployed independent of their campaigns.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Stand With Crypto's PAC, as a political arm of the "social welfare" organization that's
          classified as a 501(c)(4), will give donations directly to the candidates, Carr said,
          targeting "individuals who have demonstrated an impressive knowledge and commitment to
          crypto and blockchain innovation in America." The amounts will be limited by the
          constraints that come with direct donations. And unlike with financial support to the
          organization itself, giving to the PAC will require the donors to identify themselves
          publicly.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The group endorsed a city councilman in Oregon, Democrat Eddy Morales, who is heading into
          a congressional primary there in a couple of weeks and said on his campaign website that
          "artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies are still emerging and allow
          people to build wealth, own their own data, and have a seat at the table in the economy of
          the future," adding that he'd "focus on creating a regulatory framework that provides
          clarity to these industries."
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It also highlights Troy Downing, a Montana Republican who is the state's securities
          watchdog and is running for a House seat there amid a crowded field facing a June primary.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The group additionally endorsed three candidates that other crypto PACs have previously
          favored: Alabama Democrat Shomari Figures; Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), who just won his
          party's primary this week to pursue a Senate seat; and West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice,
          seeking the Senate seat left open by a departing Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.)
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          The endorsements will continue with future selections, Carr said, and the organization
          already has a well of incumbent candidates to choose from, because it maintains a grading
          of the members of Congress based on crypto friendliness.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Proof of State is the Wednesday edition of Fortune Crypto where Leo Schwartz delivers
          insider insights on policy and regulation. Coinbase has always been a political
          organization, with cofounder and CEO Brian Armstrong long pronouncing his vision of
          "democratizing finance" through cryptocurrency. That approach has come with its downsides,
          including a failed foray into global philanthropy and Armstrong's declaration that
          Coinbase was a "mission-focused" company in a lengthy blog post in 2021, which read as an
          anti-woke stance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          After FTX collapsed and Sam Bankman-Fried stopped wandering the halls of Capitol Hill,
          Coinbase seemed to finally feel comfortable in its role as an advocacy organization,
          spearheading donation efforts and elevating its lobbying arm, not just in D.C. but across
          the country. In August, Coinbase introduced the Stand With Crypto Alliance, a 501(c)(4)
          "social welfare" nonprofit tasked with "unleashing" the power of the 50 million Americans
          who hold a digital asset.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          As I wrote about last week, I am skeptical, to say the least, of the existence of a crypto
          voter: someone who doesn't work in the industry yet will be swayed to come to the polls
          because of the perceived injustice wrought by regulators.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In its six-odd months of operation, Stand With Crypto has gotten results, with its
          trademark shield omnipresent in profile names across Crypto Twitter. The organization
          claims a successful digital campaign with more than 310,000 "advocates" and $86 million in
          donations, although you have to hover over the number on its homepage to see the fine
          print: That figure includes the super PAC Fairshake, which has received over $85 million
          in funding from prominent crypto figures like Armstrong.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Coinbase's efforts are not just in Twitter degen circles and clubby fundraising circles,
          however. Stand With Crypto has been flying entrepreneurs to D.C. to meet with the offices
          of prominent lawmakers like Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and hosting town halls in places
          like Ohio and New York to bring together community members (again, mostly crypto
          entrepreneurs) and local lawmakers to talk policy. It even hosted a presidential debate in
          New Hampshire in December, although it was only attended by third-tier candidates like
          Vivek Ramaswamy and Dean Phillips.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          I headed to Boston last week to attend one of the town halls. Stand With Crypto hosted the
          event at the University of Massachusetts Club, a swanky venue on the 32nd floor of a
          skyscraper overlooking the city's trademark Citgo sign. About 100 people gathered—a good
          showing of Coinbase employees, including head of policy Kara Calvert, as well as local
          blockchain founders and organizations like the Boston DAO, which sports a Dunkin'-themed
          logo. There was even one attendee who seemed to fit my parameters of the mythical crypto
          voter—although he sadly declined to be interviewed; the search continues.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          One of the panels included a state legislator, a Democrat named Kate Lipper-Garabedian,
          whom I caught up with afterward. She is interested in blockchain as a way to modernize
          bureaucratic nuisances like deeds and student records, introducing a number of bills,
          including one that would direct the state treasurer to put together an online financial
          literacy module for investing in digital assets. She gave a refreshing perspective that
          she doesn't even follow the morass around the security versus commodity debate,
          understanding that it's beyond her purview. When I asked whether she was disappointed that
          Warren has taken such a firmly anti-crypto stance, she gave the type of polite nonanswer
          that made me think we'll see her on the national stage soon. Warren challenger John
          Deaton, sadly, did not make an appearance.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          It's easy to get caught up in the federal roadblock, but Coinbase's strategy to focus on
          the local level makes sense. There is legislative progress actually happening on the state
          level, after all, from New York to California to Illinois, and maybe even in Warren's home
          state of Massachusetts. "The states aren't going to just sit around and not compete,"
          Calvert told me.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Whether Coinbase's strategy bears fruit on the state or federal level is still an open
          question. The road show, however, continues. Next up is California, where Stand With
          Crypto is hosting a Get Out the Vote event in Los Angeles with Armstrong and the rapper
          Nas. I guess the bull market really is back.

          Already this year there has been major, bipartisan momentum in Congress, driven by SWC
          member outreach. In May, Congress voted to pass H.R.4763, the Financial Innovation and
          Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21). In support of FIT21, Stand with Crypto
          advocates made over 28,000 contacts with Congress via calls and emails. Additionally,
          founders of over one hundred crypto companies, representing over 1,200 American jobs in
          the industry, signed a letter of support for the legislation.

          SWC has also been highly involved in key political races this year. In the critical Super

          68,000 door-to-door voter contacts to the over 8.2 million California adults who currently
          own cryptocurrency - a powerful voting bloc in the state known for setting the direction
          of the nation. The Stand With Crypto PAC has endorsed 21 candidates.

          IRL in the Atlanta, GA area which led him to business development and partnerships with
          Umba Daima (meaning "Create Forever" in the Swahili language), a Web3 Studio based in
          Atlanta supporting creatives by educating and onboarding them into the Web3 space. In

          fundraising platform accepting over 100+ cryptocurrencies, increasing revenue, and funding
          newly developed programs. At the beginning of this year, Anthony became more involved with

          WASHINGTON D.C. - Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Financial Innovation

          Earlier this week, founders of over one hundred crypto companies, representing over 1,200

          them to support the legislation.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          This week's advocacy is a continuation of Stand With Crypto's role as a leading voice
          supporting the growing crypto community, beginning with the first-ever crypto presidential
          forum. Held at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics in December 2023, three
          presidential candidates from both major political parties gathered to discuss the need for
          commonsense cryptocurrency policies. Since this event, crypto advocates have gathered
          around the country - from Atlanta to Boston and Washington, DC - to continue spreading
          this message.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Notably, Stand with Crypto was highly involved in the critical Super Tuesday primaries. In
          the days leading up to the closely watched California U.S. Senate primary, Stand with
          Crypto directed over 68,000 door-to-door voter contacts to the over 8.2 million California
          adults who currently own cryptocurrency - a powerful voting bloc in the state known for
          setting the direction of the nation.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          These grassroots efforts culminated on Monday, March 4th with Stand with Crypto's
          get-out-the-vote rally at the historic Bourbon Room in Hollywood, CA, featuring
          Grammy-winning rap artist Nas and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Over 500 crypto advocates
          registered their support at The Bourbon Room. These crypto advocates' successful efforts
          resulted in two pro-crypto candidates emerging from Super Tuesday's primary as nominees in
          November's general election.

          The 2024 electoral program will employ various voter and candidate engagement methods to
          ensure that candidates know voters are prioritizing clear, common-sense crypto regulation
          as an issue and clarify candidate's stances for voters.

          This week, SWC launched its candidate questionnaire to find out where each candidate
          stands on a common-sense national crypto policy. After responses are received and
          reviewed, SWC will release a scorecard for each candidate with the potential for financial
          support, media and social media publicity, and GOTV organizing in targeted districts.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Since SWC was launched 6 months ago, more than 300,000 people have joined this fight,
          adding 5-10% new engaged advocates every week. In addition to online activations, over 75
          crypto founders have taken part in Washington, DC fly-ins, and have met with key members
          of Congress to talk about these issues.

          SWC will also be engaging in voter education on issues around crypto in the important
          California Senate primary race, with a plan to knock on 50,000 doors to make sure voters
          who care about where their candidates stand on issues surrounding crypto.

          To date, SWC has already held a Presidential primary candidates event in New Hampshire,
          and has held 6 roundtable events across the country. This year there will be additional
          candidate forums for Congressional candidates in Michigan, Alabama, and Pennsylvania,
          where voters will hear directly from the candidates on where they are on this important
          issue. Additional candidate events are forthcoming.
