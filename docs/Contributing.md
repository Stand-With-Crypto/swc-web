# Contributing Guide

To ensure we continue to ship maintainable, performant, and bug-free code, all new contributions should be reviewed and approved by _at least one_ core contributor.

## When do I need to get a code review?

Generally, you'll want to request a code review once your branch is feature-complete and has passed all CI checks. If the feature you're working on has architectural complexity, and if you would like feedback before finishing the work, then you can also request a review sooner to get additional guidance.

If you're working on a change that is time sensitive (_e.g._ production is down) and/or you have a very high degree of confidence in what you're shipping (_e.g._ there's a misspelled word, or you're adding logs), core contributors can merge without review. _However, this should be an exception, not the norm_.

## Who do I request a review from?

You'll generally want to try to solicit a review from whoever has the most context about the domain you're working on. If you're unsure who has the most context, you can check the Git history or ask one of the core contributors for assistance. You can include others on the PR as "assignees" to solicit additional feedback and encourage others working on the codebase to learn by reviewing your code.

If you've been requested as a reviewer, but you don't think you have sufficient context or you think there's someone else on the team that would provide more value, feel free to reassign to someone else with an explanation.

## What do I need to include in my PR when I open it?

Outside the obvious bits (you need to include the actual code changes), the main thing to include is context:

- If the PR is related to a GitHub issue, make sure you reference that issue in the PR.
- If there are specific sections you have concerns about, include commentary describing the things you'd like the reviewers to consider.
- If there are areas that don't need review (large whitespace diffs, file structure refactors), feel free to call that out as well to guide the reviewer.
  - HINT: if your code involves a bunch of cosmetic refactors (renames, pulling code in to new files, folder structure updates), you might want to merge a separate PR that does all those changes first, so that it's clear what logic changes you made in the actual final PR.

## I've been assigned code to review - what now?

Once you've gone through the PR, adding any comments/questions you might have, you can "Submit Review" with one of the following values:

- "Request Changes" - Use this when you have comments that need to be addressed before the code can be merged.
- "Approve" - Ship it. If there are minor edits you'd suggest making, but you don't believe those necessitate another round of review, you can approve the PR with your comments.

## My code has been approved - what now?

**Please ensure you merge any PlanetScale deploy requests to the testing database before merging the PR's code** (see "Updating the PlanetScale schema" section for more details). After you have done that, then you (or the author of the PR) can merge, close the PR, and delete the branch after they have approval from reviewers.

All features should be deployed to production by the engineer that merged the feature in to testing:

- First, if there are database schema changes, open another PlanetScale deploy request against production
  - Verify that the schema updates from testing -> production mirrors the schema updates from your PR's branch -> testing
  - Merge the deploy request to update production database (see "Updating the PlanetScale schema" section for details on backwards compatibility and why schema changes are always merged before code)
- Run `bin/deploy_web_production.sh` to deploy your code changes to Vercel

## I need to make database schema changes/migrations as part of my PR - what now?

We use PlanetScale as our database host provider. They have a number of [GitHub actions](https://planetscale.com/blog/announcing-the-planetscale-github-actions) that should simplify our CI process for database migrations, but until they're fully implemented in our codebase, below are some process steps when updating our database schema.

NOTE: these steps will only work for core contributors currently - if you need access to Vercel, then reach out to a core contributor:

### Fixing your Vercel PR branch

If you have schema changes/migrations to make, then your Vercel preview branch will need to be pointing to _your_ PlanetScale development database branch that you used for local development (_e.g._ the PlanetScale branch that you've run `npx prisma db push` on) via updating the `DATABASE_URL`. To update this environment variable:

- _This step only needs to be done once_:
  - Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) locally.
  - Run `vercel login --github` to login to our instance. Ensure that the authentication proceeds with the correct email address.
  - `cd` into your local swc-web repository.
  - Run `vercel link`.
    - Say "y" to the set up.
    - Select "Stand With Crypto" as the scope containing the project.
    - Say "y" to the "stand-with-crypto/swc-web" project.
- Run `vercel env add DATABASE_URL preview [name-of-your-branch]`, and supply your development database URL.
  - Alternatively you can run `sh ./bin/add_preview_database_url_env.sh`. This will automatically use the `DATABASE_URL` from your local `.env` file.
  - This will update your preview branch's `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in Vercel.
  - Afterwards, you can redeploy your preview branch in Vercel, and your branch should pick up your custom `DATABASE_URL`.
- Once your preview branch has been merged to main, please clean up your branch-specific `DATABASE_URL` by running `sh ./bin/remove_preview_database_url_env.sh`.

At any point, if you want an additional sanity check for the existence of your environment variable, you can log into the Vercel website and check for your environment variable.

### Updating the PlanetScale schema

- All schema changes made should be [backwards compatible](https://planetscale.com/blog/safely-making-database-schema-changes#backwards-compatible-changes)
  - If you're unsure of whether a change is backwards compatible:
    - Checkout `main` and `npx prisma db push` to ensure your local dev branch reflects the latest schema from testing
    - Checkout your feature branch with the schema changes and run `npx prisma db push`. The CLI will warn you of potential issues
  - Because you can't have vercel update at the exact same time as database migrations, you want to ensure that you ship code in a way where the database can be updated before any code is updated, and nothing breaks. This generally means merging code to testing
- To update the testing/production database schema, open a [deploy request](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/deploy-requests) against testing, [select the database branch](https://app.planetscale.com/stand-with-crypto/swc-web/branches) with the new schema updates and open a "deploy request" against testing. Please make sure to follow the same step of opening a deploy request from testing --> production before deploying from testing to production.

## Adding Environment Variables

If you need to add environment variables, please ensure the following:

- You update the `.env.example` with commentary explaining how to get the value
- If you are a core contributor
  - Add it to our shared secrets vault
  - Update `.github/workflows/cypress.yml` and reach out to @travisbloom-cb add it to our github secrets
  - Update our vercel environment variables
  - Alert the rest of the core contributors that they need to update their local environment
