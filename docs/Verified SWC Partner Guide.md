# Verified SWC Partner Guide

For verified partners, Stand With Crypto provides APIs that allow you to programmatically subscribe and perform actions on behalf of users. See the `/src/app/api/verified-swc-partner` folder for all available API endpoints.

## API Response Structure

All successful API responses will return a `VerifiedSWCPartnerApiResponse` that has the following shape:

```
export type VerifiedSWCPartnerApiResponse<ResultOptions extends string> = {
  result: ResultOptions;
  resultOptions: ResultOptions[];
  sessionId: string;
  userId: string;
}
```

The `result` string will be an endpoint-specific string that describes the result of the action and the `resultOptions` will describe all possible successful response results the API endpoint returns.

## Structuring Deep Links from API responses

After an API request is triggered, the partner may wish to deeplink the user in to Stand With Crypto for future actions. All URL deep links should include the returned `sessionId` and `userId` as query params in the url. For example, if the partner wanted to redirect the user to the Stand With Crypto homepage, the URL structure would be `https://www.standwithcrypto.org?userId=[the returned user id]&sessionId=[the returned session id]`. Passing these query params ensures that we can correctly identify the user as they land on standwithcrypto.org.

## Current Endpoints
